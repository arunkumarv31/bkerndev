It is a simple code working with qemu or any pen drive
make the code
just do qemu loader.bin

to install it into a pen drive
dd if=loader.bin of=/dev/sdc count=512 bs=1

be careful with the output(of) device clear the dmesg (dmesg -c) before inserting a usb drive and after inserting the pen drive check 'dmesg' there /dev/sdb or sdc will be shown.

qemu loader.bin 
qemu /dev/sdc

or to see it in real reboot the system making usb boot high priority in bios

AA55 - boot signature (Google it)
